Now, more than ever, technology allows us to reshape existing content in order to create new messages and expressions. What does it mean to utilize “found media” in order to create new work — and how can we use the process to comment on the status quo of our current cultural and social landscapes?  

This course explores remix, recontextualization, and reappropriation as artistic tools. We will examine current and past usage of the remix, from its well-known place in popular music to its application in broader forms such as YouTube and video mashups, cut-ups and text generators, Internet memes, culture jamming, and parody. The class will also cover common legal issues surrounding remix culture, such as fair use, debate over current copyright laws, and the Creative Commons community and licensing system. These ideas will be further investigated through weekly reading assignments, class discussion and presentations, guest speakers, and the development of original remix projects.  

This two-credit course will meet the last seven weeks of the semester.  

### Week 1: Hello Remix
- Introductions
- Why are we here?
- What does "remix" actually mean?
- Read-only (RO) culture vs. read-write (RW) culture
- Collage, montage & the first forms of recontextualization 

Each week, two or three students will be responsible for putting together a 5-7 minute presentation on the following week's topic. The students will each pick ONE example of what we will be discussing in class and talk about the work, how it is an example of remix, the elements being recontextualized, and how the work uses those elements in a new and/or improved context.

The source videos should be re-arranged to tell an entirely different story (term used loosely) from the initial intent. You are not allowed to shoot any new footage for this assignment. If you need ideas or inspiration, refer to the examples shown in class this week.
