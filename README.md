Class Time: Thursdays, 3:20 - 5:50PM  
Office Hours: TBD  

Now, more than ever, technology allows us to reshape existing content in order to create new messages and expressions. What does it mean to utilize “found media” in order to create new work — and how can we use the process to comment on the status quo of our current cultural and social landscapes?  

This course explores remix, recontextualization, and reappropriation as artistic tools. We will examine current and past usage of the remix, from its well-known place in popular music to its application in broader forms such as YouTube and video mashups, cut-ups and text generators, Internet memes, culture jamming, and parody. The class will also cover common legal issues surrounding remix culture, such as fair use, debate over current copyright laws, and the Creative Commons community and licensing system. These ideas will be further investigated through weekly reading assignments, class discussion and presentations, guest speakers, and the development of original remix projects.  

This two-credit course will meet the last seven weeks of the semester. 

### Class Expectations
<strong>Attendance:</strong> You are expected to attend every class session, and to arrive on time. Two (2) absences or more will result in a failing grade. Unexcused lateness of more than 15 minutes will result in an absence for that day.  

<strong>Participation:</strong> Participation is very important and will impact grading. All students are expected to contribute during class discussions. Please pay attention when fellow students are presenting their work and be prepared to give thoughtful, considerate feedback. Keep all feedback related to the work only; personal attacks will not be tolerated.  

<strong>Laptops:</strong> Laptops are a wonderful tool and strongly encouraged in class, as I will be showing a lot of links and demos online with which you might want to follow along. As a general rule, I don't care if you're on your laptop when I'm speaking, but there will be a lids-down policy enforced during class discussion, or when your fellow students are presenting work.  

<strong>Credit where credit is due:</strong> This is a class explicitly about re-using content to create new work, which means we are naturally going to be relying on other people's creative efforts as a basis for our own. However, that doesn't mean plagiarism is condoned. Please credit sources, inspiration, and code wherever necessary. 

<strong>Required text:</strong> <em>Remix: Making Art and Commerce Thrive in the Hybrid Economy</em> by Lawrence Lessig (available in hardcover, paperback, Kindle, or as a free download [here](https://archive.org/details/LawrenceLessigRemix))

This syllabus is a living document and will evolve every week with links to readings and resources. If you come across anything interesting in your work or research, send it to me and I'll post it here for the class. I will also be posting sample code in this repo.  

I welcome feedback and am eager to hear your thoughts about the class.  If something isn’t working for you, do not hesitate to let me know.  The sooner I find out about any issues, the sooner I can fix them!

Each week, two or three students will be responsible for putting together a 5-7 minute presentation on the following week's topic. The students will each pick ONE example of what we will be discussing in class and talk about the work, how it is an example of remix, the elements being recontextualized, and how the work uses those elements in a new and/or improved context.
